Features to Implement
=====================
Please try adding the following features (feel free to make any code improvements and refactoring you deem necessary);

1) Feature One
As an api consumer,
I want the /questions endpoint to return all questions available in the question repository.
So that I can retrieve the questions available for a quiz.

2) Feature Two
As an api consumer,
I want an endpoint to check a given answer for any available question is correct.
So that I can validate the answers for each question in the quiz.

3) Feature Three
As an api consumer,
I want to retrieve a different set of questions for a Science quiz depending on the type of quiz e.g. Geography Quiz or Science Quiz
So that I can support providing different types of quiz.

Good luck!
